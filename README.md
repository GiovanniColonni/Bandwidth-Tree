# Bandwidth-Tree
Implementation of a hierarchical data structure called Bandwidth Tree which records the interval for available link bandwidth instead of unit time slot. Used for QoS purpose

# MinBW

return the minimum aggregate bandwidth on a time interval [c,d) given the root of the bandwidth tree or a root of a bandwidth of a subtree.

# To Ask

1. do I need the most efficient ds? is it fine if the implementation of the tree is between linked list even if th heap would be faster ?

2. test framework:
    - show how the tree works and all the various cases
    - 3/4 topology for testing
